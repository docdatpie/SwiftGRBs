# SwiftGRBs

Data parsing and merging of Swift GRBs table with BdHNe table

Here you'll find the notebook with steps to add RA,Dec and trigger time
of GRBs first published by this IBdHNe table, by Ruffini et al. 2017.
The notebook goes through getting the all-GRBs table from NASA's Swift
service, converting-filtering-transforming the columns and finally
merging a subset of the events to the original/source table.
